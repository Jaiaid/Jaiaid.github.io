<p>I am Jaiaid Mobin. Graduate research assistant in <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/">RIT HPDSL</a>.</p>
<p>I am a student of Computer Science but I am also interested in other fields of science, especially physics, chemistry, biology and earth science. I wish to know how the world around me works. This is the motivation behind my interest in science.</p>
<p>In my leisure, I like to do personal project related to programming. I also have hobby of stargazing and watching video game walkthrough in youtube.</p>

<h4>Current Work</h4>
<p>Currently I am working (started from August 25th, 2022) as a graduate research assistant in High Performance and Distributed Systems Lab <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~hpdsl/index.html">(HPDSL)</a> in Rochester Institute and Technology (RIT) under Dr. M. Mustafa Rafique.</p>
<p>Here with other fellow labmates I will do research on high performance computing, distributed systems and operating systems under supervision of Dr. M. Mustafa Rafique.</p>
<p>For development platform, I am comfortable with both Linux based OS and Windows 10.</p>
