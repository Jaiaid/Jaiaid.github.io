    <br>
    This is presented as poster in HPDC'23. In this work we have proposed a system to deploy continuously learned system geared towards saving GPU resources.

    <br>
    This is part of my M.Sc. thesis work. Here we have worked on applying MOO and heuristic to solve route generation problem with objective of reducing evacuation completion time. We have evaluated our approach on evacuation dataset of Halifax city, Nova-Scotia, Canada.

    <br>
    In this work we have improved a tool for applying reference free association mapping method described <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/32920">here</a>
<br>
Our contribution is improving execution time of the existing tool and demonstrating that this tool is applicable in finding sex specific sequences

    <br>
    In this work we have used stochastic optimization technique to solve simplified transit network design problem.
<br>
Our contribution is proposing a heuristic which creates good solution in very short time for some benchmark data w.r.t some metric used in some other relevent literature. To improve solution furthur we have applied stochastic beam search. We have reported statitical significance of the improvment to justify the use of stochastic optimization.
